# FlockSim

A 2D flocking simulation where birds (boids) evolve and interact based on their genetic makeup.

## What it does

- **Flocking:** Birds naturally flock together using alignment, separation, and cohesion behaviors
- **Genetics:** Each bird has a unique genetic code that determines how it interacts with others
- **Signaling:** Birds can communicate with genetically similar neighbors, creating visible connection lines
- **Evolution:** Birds reproduce when close together, mixing their genes to create offspring
- **Lifespan:** Birds age and eventually die, making room for new generations

## How it works

Each bird starts with a random genetic string. Birds with similar genes are drawn to each other through signaling (shown as web-like lines). When birds get close enough, they reproduce by combining and mutating their genes. The bird's color reflects its genetic makeup.

This creates clusters of genetically similar birds that evolve over time - similar to how ideas spread and cluster on social media platforms.
